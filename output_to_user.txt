I have systematically gone through all identified instances in the application code where `name` was being incorrectly accessed on `asset` and `employee` objects, and corrected them to `product_name` and `full_name` respectively.

This comprehensively addresses the "Error checking out asset: column "name" does not exist" error that was originating from the application code attempting to access non-existent properties.

Please **restart your local development server** once more to ensure all the latest changes are loaded, and then try the asset checkout process again.
